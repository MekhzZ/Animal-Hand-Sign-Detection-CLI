# Animal Hand Sign Detection CLI

## Overview

This project is for experimental purpose where I want to explore more features of SVM using OpenCV. It is a command-line interface (CLI) application for recognizing animal hand signs using a trained SVM classifier and Mediapipe for hand tracking. The application captures video input from a webcam, detects hand signs, and outputs the recognized animal name in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time hand sign detection using webcam.
- Utilizes an SVM classifier trained on animal hand sign data.
- Outputs the name of the recognized animal.
- Supports multiple animal signs.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- NumPy

### Virtual Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. **Activate Virtual Envioronment**
- On Windows
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
- On MacOS/Linux
    ```bash
   venv\bin\activate
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Getting Started
### Clone the Repository
